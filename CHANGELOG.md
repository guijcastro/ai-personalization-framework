## Release Notes

### Version 1.0.0 - Initial Release

This is the first public release of the AI Personalization Restoration Framework. It provides a complete, production-ready system for restoring AI model personalization after updates.

**Core Features:**
- Cross-model compatibility (tested on GPT, Claude, DeepSeek)
- Systematic 6-stage restoration process
- Memory conflict detection and resolution
- Portable, auditable, reproducible configurations
- No fine-tuning required

**Documentation:**
- Complete methodology guide
- Quick start guide (30-minute implementation)
- Technical architecture explanation
- Real-world examples

**Tools:**
- Validation script for pre-restoration checks
- Template for structured backup

**Community:**
- Contributing guidelines
- Code of conduct
- Issue templates

**Success Metrics:**
- 85-90% behavioral preservation fidelity
- Cross-platform portability
- Hours instead of weeks to restore
- Complete audit trail

**Known Limitations:**
- Large personalizations (>5000 words) may require modularization
- Memory analysis (Stage 3) requires models with persistent memory
- Initial learning curve for complex configurations

**Feedback Welcome:**
